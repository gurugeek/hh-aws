hh-aws

This package is a Common Lisp library for acessing the APIs of Amazon Web Services.  Current services supported are:

* Simple Storage Service (S3)
* SimpleDB (SDB)
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Simple Queue Service (SQS)

All code in this package is licensed under the MIT License.

When possible, the library uses the REST versions of AWS APIs, rather than SOAP.  Also, unfortunately, the library
is still using older versions of some Amazon services, and are in need of update to newer versions of Amazon APIs.

Contact phil@haphazardhouse.net for any questions, comments, feedback, or contributions, and keep an eye on
http://haphazardhouse.net/projects/hh-aws for info and news about this library.

Thanks!
